    "# `JuMP.jl`: A Brief Initial Introduction\n",
    "Here we present an initial introduction to using `JuMP.jl`. We will focus on the core modeling aspects as motivated by a simple linear programming problem. Note that this content takes inspiration from https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started_with_JuMP/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "We will not be able to cover all of `JuMP.jl`'s capabilities today. Good references are:\n",
    "- The tutorials, examples, manuals, and guides in `JuMP.jl`'s documentation: https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/\n",
    "- The Julia optimization forum: https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt/13\n",
    "- Julia Programming for Operations Research 2/e (not always up-to-date): https://www.softcover.io/read/7b8eb7d0/juliabook2/introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "This short course project already has `JuMP.jl` installed with the necessary solver packages. For reference, let's consider how to add `JuMP` and appropriate solvers to a project environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",

    "(@v1.7) pkg> activate .\n",
    "\n",
    "(@MyProject) pkg> add JuMP, HiGHS, Ipopt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here `HiGHS` acts an appropriate LP solver and `Ipopt` acts as an appropriate NLP solver. The list of supported solvers and the problems types they can solve is provided at https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Supported-solvers.\n",
