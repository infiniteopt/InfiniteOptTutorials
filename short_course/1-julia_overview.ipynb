From then on, they will be much faster. In many applications, this isn't a big problem. However, sometimes this can be a barrier. Here we will discuss 2 ways to avoid this.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use PackageCompiler\n",
    "In cases where we would like to remove the latency completely, we can use `PackageCompiler.jl` to cache the compilation for future runs and thus avoid most of the start-up latency. For instance, if we have a script `model.jl` that uses `JuMP.jl` and `HiGHS.jl` we can do the following:\n",

    "    precompile_execution_file = \"model.jl\",\n",
