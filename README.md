# InfiniteOptTutorials
Welcome to InfiniteOptTutorials! Here we provide tutorials to help with becoming 
familiar with [InfiniteOpt.jl](https://github.com/pulsipher/InfiniteOpt.jl). This 
is still in its early stages, so currently our tutorials are sparse. However, more 
will be added in the future. 

The tutorials provided can be run via a browser on Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pulsipher/InfiniteOptTutorials/main)

Please visit InfiniteOpt's extensive documentation for complete information
